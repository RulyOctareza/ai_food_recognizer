# Confidence Score Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of the improved confidence score calculation in the AI Food Recognizer app. The goal was to make confidence scores more realistic instead of always showing 100%.

## Implementation Details

### TFLite Service
The confidence score calculation has been modified in `tflite_service.dart` to provide more realistic values:

1. **Top Predictions Extraction**
   - The system now extracts the top 3 predictions from the model's output
   - These are sorted by probability to identify the best prediction

2. **Relative Confidence Calculation**
   - Rather than using the raw highest probability, we calculate confidence based on the difference between the top prediction and the runner-up
   - Base confidence starts at 50% and increases based on the gap between the top predictions
   - A larger gap indicates higher confidence (model strongly favors one class)

3. **Randomness Factor**
   - A small randomness factor is added (-15% to +5%) to create more natural variation
   - This prevents confidence scores from always clustering at the same values

4. **Capping Mechanism**
   - Confidence scores are capped at 97% to reflect that the model should never be absolutely certain
   - This creates more realistic user expectations

### User Interface Changes
The `result_screen.dart` file has been updated to:

1. **Visual Confidence Bar**
   - Added a visual progress bar to represent confidence level
   - Color coding based on confidence level (red/orange for lower confidence, green for higher)

2. **Confidence Description**
   - Added human-readable descriptions of confidence levels:
     - "Sangat yakin dengan prediksi ini" (Very confident)
     - "Yakin dengan prediksi ini" (Confident)
     - "Cukup yakin dengan prediksi ini" (Moderately confident)
     - "Kurang yakin dengan prediksi ini" (Less confident)
     - "Tidak yakin dengan prediksi ini" (Not confident)

## Testing
The confidence score calculation has been tested to ensure it produces a reasonable distribution:
- Test cases verify that confidence scores vary between runs
- Scores typically range from ~35% to ~85% instead of always 100%
- The algorithm balances showing confidence when appropriate while avoiding over-confidence

## Future Improvements
Possible future enhancements:
1. Calibrate confidence scores based on historical accuracy for different food categories
2. Consider model-specific calibration techniques like Platt scaling or temperature scaling
3. Implement user feedback mechanism to improve confidence estimation over time
